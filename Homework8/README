my program can be compiled on any machine with c++ standard library tools. 

Once ran, it will ask you how do you want to generate numbers. It can be randomly, manually, reverse order up to n, or swap consectutive pairs up to n. 

The next screen will ask what sort you would like to use. All my sorting functions work

On average, the numbers I got were: 

Selection Sort was n - l 
Insertion sort was n^2
Quicksort was n^2 
mergersort was nlogn



For the most part, i feel like my data agrees with what we discussed in class. 

My functions work perfectly fine and they sort vectors. I also added the option to pick the number of digits and manipulate n.

I noticed you said my program had errors? what errors did I have? It runs perfectly on my side.
